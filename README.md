# Population Prediction Model

This project aims to predict the population growth of a city using historical data. The prediction model combines Newton's Interpolation, Newton's Raphson Method, and Curve Fitting techniques to provide an integrated prediction for future population growth.

## Project Structure

- `population_data.csv`: Contains the historical population data with columns `Year` and `Population`.
- `population_prediction.py`: Main script that implements the prediction models and integrates them for future predictions.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib

You can install the required packages using pip:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib
